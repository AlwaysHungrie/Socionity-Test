I have tried to recreate a part of the design in a short amount of time. The website is not responsive and animations/links are not there. 

If you log on from google id, which has your name and profile picture, you will see your first name in middle of the screen and profile picture on top left.

### Issues in project
Not responsive
Dual color text might not work
Animation not there

## A feature I would like to add
It would be really cool if we could allow user to upload a high res picture with solid background, remove the background using image processing and then add it as a background to the homescreen.
