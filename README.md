### link to test project (created in about 2 hours): [link](https://socionity-test.herokuapp.com)

`google login not working on firefox due to policy`
  
I have tried to recreate a part of the design in a short amount of time. The website is not responsive and animations/links are not there. 

If you log on from google id, which has your name and profile picture, you will see your first name in middle of the screen and profile picture on top left.
